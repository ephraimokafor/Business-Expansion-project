									<h2><a href="http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html#">INTRODUCTION<br>
									</a>
The CEO and CMO want a concise, trustworthy view of how the online retail store performed historically and which areas offer the greatest growth opportunities. The main deliverables requested were four visuals answering:
Monthly revenue time series for 2011 (seasonality/forecasting).


Top 10 revenue-generating countries (excluding the UK) showing both revenue and quantity sold.


Top 10 customers by revenue, sorted descending (customer ranking).


Demand by country/region (excluding the UK) on a single view for expansion decisions.


The senior team needs correct visuals because management decisions (expansion, marketing spend, stock planning, VIP customer programs) will be made from these charts.

								</header>
								<a href="http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html#" class=""><img src="http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html" alt="">Problem statement: 
Senior management faces three practical problems:
Forecasting &amp; capacity planning: Without clear month-by-month seasonality, the CEO can’t forecast inventory needs or marketing timing.


Geographic expansion decisions: The CEO needs a global view of demand (excluding the UK) to prioritise countries/regions for expansion.


Customer retention &amp; revenue concentration: The CMO needs to know which customers generate most revenue (top 10) to protect and grow that segment while ensuring concentration risk is understood.


Underlying these problems is a data quality risk: transactional records include negative quantities (returns) and erroneous unit prices, which must be removed/handled before analysis.
</a>
								<ul class="actions special">
									<li><a href="http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html#" class="button large">Objectives :
Primary aims:
Produce accurate, easy-to-interpret visuals answering the four questions above.


Clean the transactional data to ensure all analysis is trustworthy (filter returns/errors).


Deliver actionable, prioritised recommendations for growth, marketing, product stocking, and customer retention.


Success criteria:
Each visual clearly answers the business question with no misleading axes, correct sorting, and appropriate granularity.


Forecast inputs incorporate observed seasonality (monthly) for 2011 and support a short-term forecast.


The geographic map shows all countries (excluding the UK) in a single, scroll-free view, highlighting target expansion opportunities.



</a> Data &amp; Data cleaning (methodology – stage 1)
Files seen: visuals in the folder (images), but not the raw dataset. Below are the clean-up steps to run on the transactional dataset prior to analysis:
Load the transactional data (fields expected: InvoiceNo, StockCode, Description, Quantity, InvoiceDate, UnitPrice, CustomerID, Country).


Type conversion &amp; timestamping: parse InvoiceDate to datetime; create Year, Month, MonthYear fields.


Remove cancelled transactions/returns: filter out rows where Quantity &lt; 1. (If returns are recorded as negative quantities but need to be included as return analytics, then isolate them to a separate returns analysis — they must not be mixed into positive sales aggregates.)


Remove invalid unit prices: filter out rows where UnitPrice &lt;= 0. (Alternatively, if there are a few zeroes that look like legitimate promotions, validate manually.)


Handle missing CustomerIDs: if CustomerID is missing, decide — either exclude from customer ranking or attempt imputation only if safe.


Deduplicate/remove test data: remove test invoices, cancelled rows or clearly erroneous stock codes.


Create derived metrics: Revenue = Quantity * UnitPrice; aggregate at month/country/customer levels as needed.


Validation checks: totals before and after cleaning; random row inspection; check for anomalies (very large unit price or quantity outliers).


(These checks implement the exact conditional formulas you were asked to apply: Quantity &gt;= 1 and UnitPrice &gt; 0.)


Analysis methodology (stage 2)
High-level steps to produce the visuals and insight:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):


Produce summary stats (total revenue, total qty, orders, customers, average order value).


Visualise distributions (unit price, revenue per invoice, qty per invoice).


Time series aggregation (Question 1):


Filter data for Year = 2011.


Aggregate Revenue by Month (Jan–Dec).


Visualise monthly revenue as a line chart with markers; overlay 12-month moving average and annotate peaks/troughs and notable events (promos/holidays).


Fit a forecasting model (see Modelling below) for a short-term forecast.


Top countries (Question 2):


Exclude UK (Country != 'United Kingdom').


Aggregate by country: Revenue and Quantity.


Sort by Revenue descending and select the top 10.


Visual: dual-axis or combined grouped bar: revenue as bars (descending left to right), quantity as line or second bars. Add data labels and currency formatting.


Top customers (Question 3):


Aggregate Revenue by CustomerID.


Sort descending and take the top 10 customers.


Visual: horizontal bar chart sorted descending (largest at top). Use consistent colour highlighting top 3. Include CustomerID + revenue, and optionally number of orders or average order value, to profile them.


Demand by country/region (Question 4):


Exclude the UK. Aggregate Quantity or Revenue by country.


Visual: world choropleth or proportional symbol map (circle size ~ demand). Because the CEO asked for a single view, no hovering or scrolling, ensure the map fits one screen with clear labels — or provide a sorted table plus choropleth side-by-side. Use a diverging/stepped colour palette, but since we only deliver images, ensure the legend is clear.


KPIs &amp; Dashboard:


Create a one-page dashboard with: Total Revenue (YTD), Revenue growth vs prior year, Average Order Value, Total Customers, Repeat Rate, Top Country, Top Customer, and Returns %.


Validation &amp; story checks:


Confirm monotonic sorting, axis scales, dual-axis pitfalls avoided (prefer shared scale or clear labelling), and consistent currency units.


</li>Modelling (what I recommend and why)
You asked for forecasting and identifying growth opportunities — below are the modelling choices and the intended outputs.
A. Time series forecasting (for the monthly 2011 → next year forecast)
Models to try: Facebook/Meta Prophet (quick, handles seasonality &amp; holidays), SARIMA (for interpretability), and an ensemble if desired.


Input: Monthly revenue aggregated for 2011 (plus earlier years if available).


Output: 12-month forecast with 80% &amp; 95% confidence intervals, and decomposition into trend/seasonality/residuals.


Evaluation: backtest using rolling origin (if earlier years present) and metrics MAE, RMSE.


B. Customer segmentation &amp; CLV modelling
Technique: RFM analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) to segment customers; K-means or hierarchical clustering to formalise segments.


Advanced: Predictive CLV model (e.g., BG/NBD + Gamma-Gamma or machine learning regression model) to rank customers by expected future value.


Use: identify VIPs, retention priority, and target promotions.


C. Geospatial demand &amp; expansion scoring
Technique: Rank countries by a multi-factor score: recent revenue growth rate, revenue per capita (or per online user proxy), quantity sold, average order value, returns rate, and logistics cost proxy.


Output: priority list of countries with expected ROI for expansion.


D. Product performance (if product data available)
Technique: ABC analysis (Pareto) to identify top stock-keeping units by revenue; support product bundling and stocking decisions.


E. NLP / CV (optional advanced)
NLP: Analyse customer reviews/feedback for sentiment and product pain points.


CV: If product images &amp; returns have visual reasons (damaged goods), computer vision can help categorise.

										<h2><a href="http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html#">Visualisation choices — recommended chart types (mapping to your questions)<br>
										I aligned the visuals to what leadership asked for and to best practices:
Q1 (2011 monthly revenue): Line chart with monthly points (Jan–Dec), 12-month moving average overlay and seasonal decomposition panel. Annotate major peaks (holiday season, promotion weeks) for context. (You already have 2011 MONTHLY SALES TREND.png in the folder — that’s the right visual form.)


Q2 (Top 10 countries by revenue + quantity, exclude UK): Grouped bar chart or bar + line (combo):


Bars = Revenue (descending), Line = Quantity or second axis for quantity.


Add data labels and exclude the UK filter.


Alternative: small multiples showing revenue and quantity side-by-side for each country.


Q3 (Top 10 customers by revenue): Horizontal sorted bar chart (largest to smallest) with customer IDs on y-axis, revenue on x-axis. Highlight the top 3 customers with a different colour and show the secondary metric (orders or average order value) as a label.


Q4 (Demand by country excluding UK): Choropleth world map with countries shaded by demand or a bubble map (circle size = demand). Since the CEO requested one single view with no hovering/scrolling, also include a small ranked table (top 15) next to the map so numbers are visible immediately.


Dashboard / KPIs: One-page with KPI tiles, a sparkline for trend, the monthly line chart, top countries bar, and top customer bar — made in Power BI or Tableau. Use a consistent colour palette and clear currency formatting.

									<p>Data analytics — what to inspect in each visual (how management should read them)

										Q1 monthly trend:
Look for recurring peaks (holiday season, end of quarter) and troughs.


Compute month-over-month and year-over-year % changes.


If one or two months concentrate a high share of revenue, plan promotions and inventory accordingly.


Q2 top countries:
Compare revenue share vs population/marketing spend to detect efficiency.


High revenue + low quantity → high AOV markets (premium buyers).


High quantity + low revenue → high volume low price markets (operate differently for logistics &amp; pricing).


Q3 top customers:
Identify the share of revenue contributed by the top 10 (Pareto check). If a small group contributes &gt;40–50%, that’s concentration risk.


For top customers, compute churn risk (recency), repeat purchase rate, and average order value.


Q4 demand by country/region:
Rank countries by absolute demand and growth rate.


Also, evaluate returns % by country (high returns could indicate product mismatch or delivery issues).

										<h2>Key findings (based on images in your folder + recommended checks)
I reviewed the folder images (graph filenames listed above). The images indicate that you have already produced visuals aligned with the four questions. Based on those, the following high-level conclusions are what you should verify with the raw numbers:
Seasonality exists in 2011 monthly sales (the CEO’s time-series visual is in the package) — use that seasonality for forecasting and inventory planning.


A set of countries (top 10 excluding the UK) drives most revenue — prioritise these for targeted campaigns.


Revenue is concentrated among a small number of customers (top 10) — implement VIP retention and tailored offers.


Regions of high demand (map visual) are candidates for expansion, logistics partnerships and localised marketing.<a href="http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html#">

									<p> Recommendations 
 
Seasonal trends in 2011 show clear peaks toward year-end, which can guide next year’s forecasting and marketing calendar.


Top-performing countries outside the UK reveal where we should focus our international campaigns and tailor pricing strategies.


High-value customers represent a critical revenue segment — implementing retention and loyalty initiatives will help protect this base.


Demand hotspots identified on the global map highlight priority regions for potential expansion.


Going forward, I recommend automating these dashboards in Power BI or Tableau so management can monitor them in real time.
 We should also integrate forecasting models to predict future revenue and inventory needs based on seasonal trends.
Thank you — I’ll now open the floor to your questions and feedback.
